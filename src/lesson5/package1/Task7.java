//Answer the question: What is a package-private access? Create a simple program to demonstrate the package-private access.
//Tips:
// - Create two different packages
// - Create 3 classes. 2 classes should be in the first package, 3rd class - in the second package.
// - Create in one of the classes some package-private members(fields or methods).
// - In another two classes create objects of the class with package-private members and try to access its members.
